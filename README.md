# YouTube goes 5G: Benchmarking YouTube in 4G vs 5G Through Open Datasets 

- As 5G technology evolves, its performance is expected to improve over time. Therefore, the QoE of the YouTube video streaming from Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) perspective is ideal and challenging compared to 4G/LTE networks. 
- Evaluating mobile carriersâ€™ end-to-end network performance in the wild is known to be difficult and complicated. 
Critical issues for MNO include how to manage increased video traffic demands and provide a satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) experience to their end-users. 
- To ensure better QoE, understanding and monitoring the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that impact users' perceived QoE has become a trending topic.
- Therefore, we carry out a massive 4G and 5G dataset collection campaign using a commercial 4G and 5G network, where we consider YouTube as baseline for video streaming to collect Channel Metrics and YouTube QoE logs with 1-second granularity.

# Methodology
- IFRAME data API to extract player information i.e., Stalls and Quality Shifts.
  - https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference
- An Android application to collect channel level metrics e.g., CQI, RSRQ, RSRP, SNR, application download bitrate
  - We used Gnetrack Pro - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gyokovsolutions.gnettrackproplus&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1
